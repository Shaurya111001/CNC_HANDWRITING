# CNC_HANDWRITING
CNC writing machine is automatic writing machine use for typing any type of text and drawing any design on paper. CNC Writing Machine to operate, 3 axes are required basically we are using only two. The x-axis and y-axis work in unison to create a 2D image on plain paper. This x and y-axis are placed 90 degrees to each other such that any point on the plane surface is defined by a given value of x and y. The z-axis is used a lift and lower the pen onto the plain paper. Depending on the image to be drawn, the computer will generate the appropriate coordinates and send dimensionâ€™s code to the microcontroller through the USB port. The microcontroller(Arduino) interprets these coordinates and then controls the positions of the motors(stepper) to create the image or a given text. For curve, we used simple conic section equation laws for x y z dimensions(we are working on that)

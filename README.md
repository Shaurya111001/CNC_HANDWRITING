# CNC_HANDWRITING
CNC writing machine is automatic writing machine use for typing any type of text and drawing any design on paper. CNC Writing Machine to operate, 3 axes are required basically we are using only two. The x-axis and y-axis work in unison to create a 2D image on plain paper. This x and y-axis are placed 90 degrees to each other such that any point on the plane surface is defined by a given value of x and y. The z-axis is used a lift and lower the pen onto the plain paper. Depending on the image to be drawn, the computer will generate the appropriate coordinates and send dimension’s code to the microcontroller through the USB port. The microcontroller(Arduino) interprets these coordinates and then controls the positions of the motors(stepper) to create the image or a given text. For curve, we used simple conic section equation laws for x y z dimensions(we are working on that)
